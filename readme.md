## Description 

rtMoto is a WordPress 3.0 theme which supports features like post thumbnails and custom menu.

## Installation

1. Upload 'rt-moto' to the '/wp-content/themes/' directory
2. Activate the theme through the 'Themes' menu in WordPress	

Important Note:

Thumbnail generation may fail if you are using a cheap webhosting and your blog contains very large images.

In that case, you can try increasing PHP-memory by following steps here - http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Increasing_memory_allocated_to_PHP
